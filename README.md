## Financial Headlines Sentiment Analysis

This (DataCamp guided, notebook = SentAnalysis.ipynb) project performs sentiment analysis on financial news headlines downloaded from FINVIZ. Using Python, it covers data acquisition through web scraping, natural language processing (NLP) for text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization of sentiment scores over time using a plot. The primary objective is to provide insights into the sentiment trends in financial news and how they evolve over a specified period, facilitating better decision-making in the financial domain.



## EXPLORING REUTERS TEXT DATA: Trigram Language Modelling and Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques

This project (notebook = ExpReutTextData.ipynb) entails exploring the Reuters text data! We utilize Language Modelling (LM), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze the data and extract valuable insights. We fetched text data from Reuters using the NLTK package. We proceed to trigram Language Modeling, that is estimating probabilities of third words given the preceding two, revealing underlying language patterns.

The second half consist of Sentiment Analysis. Basically, analysing and identifying sentiment polarity scores in each text snippet, distinguishing positive and negative expressions. Machine Learning: Data was splitted into train/test sets, applying ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, achieving test accuracy scores between 60%-75% under default model parameters. Our project provides valuable insights into textual data analysis, showcasing the power of LM, NLP and ML in understanding language patterns and sentiment within the Reuters textual dataset.
